## What is pyprocessing? ##

Pyprocessing is a pure python based implementation of [processing](http://processing.org), based on the pyglet games engine, and hence supports OPENGL. I find [Eric5](http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/eric-download.html) to be an excellent ide for pyprocessing, and you can run sketches directly from the ide (Note Eric5 requires python3.1+, but currently pyprocessing/pyglet only supports python2.X, however Eric5 can handle running sketches with either python version 2 or 3)

## Alternatives ##
[processing.py](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py) is an alternative implementation of processing based on jython, and hence is compatible with vanilla processing libraries, but is less embedded in the python ecology (eg numpy scipy).  processing.py outperforms pyprocessing, and if you are prepared to use a beta version supports processing-2.0 features.
